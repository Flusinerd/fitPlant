## What is fitPlant?
fitPlant is an idea that is inspired by [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/).
In fitPlant you will be able to log all your workouts and make a plant grow by working out. It will most likely help some people stay motivated since they want to grow their plant as much as possible.

## Approximate roadmap of fitPlant
1. Create and plan the MVP web app of fitPlant
2. Launch web app, get feedback and integrate that feedback
3. Start working on the MVP ios and android version
4. Launch the MVP on the Play Store and App Store
5. Get feedback for both and then update
6. Start working on some cooler features

## Current status of fitPlant
- the basic idea of fitPlant is ready 
- fitPlant is still very much in the planning phase
- there is a lot of room for creativity ([check this section for things that need to be created](#open-for-creation))
- We are starting with the web app and then the iOS and Android version will start

### The MVP of fitPlant
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of fitPlant should be a fitness tracking app where you can easily add your workouts, check them out and delete them from your device and you should also be able to add new musclegroups/categories and workouts that belong to these catgories. You should also be able to grow a plant with the amount of workouts you do based on your x days per week and your x hours per workout.

## Installation of prototype for iOS
- You will need a [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/) if you want to run this on your device
- Clone this repository
- Open the `fitPlant.xcodeproj` file inside the iOS-app/prototype folder with Xcode
- You should be able to run the current master state without problems
